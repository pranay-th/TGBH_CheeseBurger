# Code Comparison Report

## Problem Statement
Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
## Candidate Solution (Python)
```Python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## Reference Solution (Python)
```
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
```

## Analysis
Similarity Score: 10/10

### Detailed Analysis of Similarities and Differences:
1. **Code Structure:** Both solutions have an identical structure. They define a function named `fibonacci` that takes a single argument `n`.
2. **Conditional Logic:** The conditional checks (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are exactly the same in both solutions, checking for the base cases where `n <= 0` and `n == 1`, and the recursive case otherwise.
3. **Recursive Calls:** Both solutions use the same recursive formula to compute the Fibonacci sequence: `fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)`.
4. **Return Values:** The return values for the base cases and the recursive case are identical across both solutions.
5. **Syntax and Formatting:** The syntax is consistent and correct in both solutions. The indentation and formatting are also identical, adhering to Python's syntax rules.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
Given that both solutions are identical and correctly implement the recursive approach to compute the Fibonacci sequence, the primary suggestion for improvement would be related to performance rather than changes to the code structure:
- **Memoization:** Implement memoization to store previously computed values of the Fibonacci sequence. This can significantly reduce the time complexity from exponential to linear by avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Iterative Approach:** Consider using an iterative approach to compute the Fibonacci sequence, which can be more efficient in terms of space complexity compared to the recursive approach.

Overall, both solutions are correct and effectively identical, with potential improvements focusing on enhancing performance rather than modifying the existing correct logic.
