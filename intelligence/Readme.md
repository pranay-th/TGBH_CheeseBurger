# Cybersecurity Integration for Proctoring System

## Overview
This document details how aspects of an existing cybersecurity agentic pipeline can be integrated into the proctoring system to enhance security and cheating detection. The tools include **Nmap, Gobuster, FFUF, and SQLMap**.

## Tool Integration and Implementations

### 1. **Nmap (Network Scanning)**
- **Purpose:** Detect unauthorized devices connected to the candidate's network during the exam.
- **Implementation:**
  - Set up Nmap scans to run periodically during exam sessions (with user consent).
  - Focus on detecting unknown devices and open ports that could be used for unauthorized access.
  - Alert the system if a new, suspicious device is detected during an exam.
- **Command Example:**
  ```bash
  nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 > network_scan_results.txt
  ```
  
### 2. **Gobuster & FFUF (Directory and Subdomain Enumeration)**
- **Purpose:** Identify hidden services or unauthorized local servers on the candidate's machine.
- **Implementation:**
  - Run Gobuster or FFUF scans to identify open directories or local services that should not be running during an exam.
  - Flag unusual findings for further investigation.
- **Command Example (Gobuster):**
  ```bash
  gobuster dir -u http://localhost:8080 -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
  ```
- **Command Example (FFUF):**
  ```bash
  ffuf -u http://localhost/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
  ```

### 3. **SQLMap (Database Vulnerability Scanning)**
- **Purpose:** Ensure backend data security by identifying and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Implementation:**
  - Perform periodic vulnerability scans on API endpoints and database interactions.
  - Ensure log and risk score data are protected from injection attacks.
- **Command Example:**
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u "http://example.com/api?query=test" --batch
  ```

## Benefits of Integration
- **Enhanced Security:** Detect and prevent sophisticated cheating methods involving external devices or hidden services.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that risk analysis data and logs are secure from external tampering.
- **System Trust:** Build a robust proctoring system trusted by institutions and candidates alike.

## Key Considerations
- **Privacy Compliance:** Clearly inform candidates about network scans and obtain consent where necessary.
- **Minimal Disruption:** Ensure scans are lightweight and do not interfere with exam performance.
- **Alert System:** Integrate a real-time alert system for any suspicious activity detected by these tools.
- **Automation:** Schedule these scans to run automatically in the background during exams.

## Next Steps
1. **Testing:** Run these integrations in a controlled environment to ensure stability.
2. **Optimization:** Adjust scanning parameters to minimize system load.
3. **Documentation:** Keep detailed logs and document all detected anomalies for review.

This integration will provide an additional layer of security and ensure that the proctoring system is robust and reliable.
